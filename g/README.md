# A simple library for sending and receiving CAN message on Linux

Standard CAN bus on linux uses a network/socket paradigm.

The functions in this library rely on the C library in "../c".

```go
type CanFrame struct {
	CanId  uint32	// CAN message ID
	CanDlc byte		// payload length (0..8)
	Data   [8]byte  // data (valid up to data length)
}

// initialize a connection to a can device
// returns a linux socket
func CanInit(dev string) int

// send a single can message
// returns number of bytes sent or < 0 if failed
// CanSend always sends sizeof CanFrame = 16
// CanDlc specifies the number of valid data bytes
func CanSend(sock int, frame *CanFrame) int

// receive a single can message
// returns number of bytes received  or < 0 if failed
// CanReceive always receives sizeof CanFrame = 16,
// CanDlc specifies the number of valid data bytes
func CanRecv(sock C.int, frame *CanFrame) int

// close the can socket
func CanClose(sock int) int
```

### ./g/can.go::line 8

GitHub Copilot: The provided Go code is a preamble to a Go file that uses cgo to call C code. cgo is a tool that allows Go programs to call C code directly.

The //#cgo CFLAGS: -g -Wall -I../c line is a directive for cgo that sets the CFLAGS environment variable. CFLAGS is used by the gcc compiler to specify flags for the compilation of the C code. In this case, -g enables debugging information, -Wall enables all warning messages, and -I../c adds ../c to the list of directories to be searched for header files.

The //#cgo LDFLAGS: -L${SRCDIR}/../c -lcan line is another directive for cgo that sets the LDFLAGS environment variable. LDFLAGS is used by the gcc linker to specify flags for the linking of the C code. In this case, -L${SRCDIR}/../c adds ${SRCDIR}/../c to the list of directories to be searched for library files, and -lcan links against the can library.

The //#include "canlib.h" line is a C preprocessor directive that includes the canlib.h header file. This header file presumably contains the declarations of the C functions and types that are used in the Go code.

Finally, the import "C" line is a special import in Go that is used when calling C code with cgo. This import enables the Go code to use C types and call C functions. It must be preceded by a blank line to separate it from the cgo directives and C preprocessor directives.

### ./g/can.go::func CanInit(dev string) int

This is the function **CanInit** for initializing a CAN (Controller Area Network) interface. The function is named CanInit and it takes one parameter, dev, which is a string representing the device to be initialized.

The function starts by declaring a variable sock of type C.int. This is a type from the C package in Go, which allows Go to interoperate with C code. This is often used when you need to call a library written in C, which seems to be the case here.

Next, the sock variable is assigned the result of a function call to C.canlib_init(C.CString(dev)). The C.canlib_init function is presumably a C function that initializes the CAN interface. The C.CString(dev) part is converting the dev string from Go into a format that the C function can understand.

Finally, the function returns the sock variable, converted to a Go int type. This is likely a file descriptor or a similar identifier that can be used to interact with the initialized device.

Remember, when working with C code in Go, you need to be careful with memory management, as Go's garbage collector won't manage memory allocated by C code.

### ./g/can.go::func CanSend(sock int, frame \*CanFrame) int

This is the function **CanSend** that sends a CAN (Controller Area Network) frame to a CAN interface. The function takes two parameters: sock, which is an integer representing the socket descriptor of the CAN interface, and frame, which is a pointer to a CanFrame struct.

The CanFrame struct is defined with three fields: CanId, CanDlc, and Data. CanId is a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the identifier of the CAN frame. CanDlc is a byte representing the data length code of the CAN frame, which specifies the number of bytes in the data field of the frame. Data is an array of 8 bytes representing the data of the CAN frame.

In the CanSend function, two local variables are declared: ret of type C.int and cframe of type C.struct_canlib_frame. ret is used to store the return value of the C function canlib_send, and cframe is a C struct that will be passed to the canlib_send function.

The fields of cframe are then populated with the values from the frame parameter. The can_id and can_dlc fields are directly assigned the values of CanId and CanDlc from frame, respectively. The data field of cframe is populated with the values from the Data field of frame using a for loop.

Finally, the canlib_send function is called with sock and the address of cframe as arguments, and its return value is stored in ret. The function then returns ret converted to a Go int. This return value is likely an error code, with a value of 0 indicating success and other values indicating specific error conditions.

### /g/can.go::func CanRecv(sock int, frame \*CanFrame, timeout int) int

This is the function **CanRecv** that receives a CAN (Controller Area Network) frame from a CAN interface. The function takes three parameters: sock, which is an integer representing the socket descriptor of the CAN interface; frame, which is a pointer to a CanFrame struct; and timeout, which is an integer representing the timeout for the receive operation in milliseconds.

The CanFrame struct is defined with three fields: CanId, CanDlc, and Data. CanId is a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the identifier of the CAN frame. CanDlc is a byte representing the data length code of the CAN frame, which specifies the number of bytes in the data field of the frame. Data is an array of 8 bytes representing the data of the CAN frame.

In the CanRecv function, two local variables are declared: ret of type C.int and cframe of type C.struct_canlib_frame. ret is used to store the return value of the C function canlib_receive, and cframe is a C struct that will be passed to the canlib_receive function.

The canlib_receive function is called with sock, the address of cframe, and timeout as arguments, and its return value is stored in ret. If ret is less than 0, the function returns ret converted to a Go int. This indicates an error occurred during the receive operation.

If ret is not less than 0, the fields of frame are populated with the values from cframe. The CanId and CanDlc fields are directly assigned the values of can_id and can_dlc from cframe, respectively. The Data field of frame is populated with the values from the data field of cframe using a for loop.

Finally, the function returns ret converted to a Go int. This return value is likely an error code, with a value of 0 indicating success and other values indicating specific error conditions.

### ./g/can.go::func CanClose(sock int) int

This is the function **CanClose** that closes a CAN (Controller Area Network) interface. The function takes one parameter: sock, which is an integer representing the socket descriptor of the CAN interface.

In the CanClose function, a local variable ret of type C.int is declared. This variable is used to store the return value of the C function canlib_close.

The canlib_close function is called with sock as an argument, and its return value is stored in ret. The canlib_close function is presumably a C function that closes the CAN interface. The C.int(sock) part is converting the sock integer from Go into a format that the C function can understand.

Finally, the function returns ret converted to a Go int. This return value is likely an error code, with a value of 0 indicating success and other values indicating specific error conditions.
