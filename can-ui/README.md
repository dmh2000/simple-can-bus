# ./can-ui/App.tsx

The provided TypeScript React code defines a functional component App that interacts with a CAN (Controller Area Network) device through a web API.

The CanDevice interface is defined to represent the state of the CAN device. It has four fields: DioSet, DioOut, DacSet, and AdcOut, all of which are numbers.

In the App component, several state variables are defined using the useState hook. canDevice is an object that represents the current state of the CAN device, and is initialized with a CanDevice object where all fields are 0. Dio and Dac are numbers that represent the current DIO and DAC values to be set on the CAN device, respectively. updateDio, updateDac, and update are boolean flags that are used to trigger updates to the CAN device.

The useEffect hook is used to create side effects in the component. The first useEffect hook sets up an interval that fetches the current state of the CAN device from the web API every second. The second and third useEffect hooks send a PUT request to the web API whenever updateDio or updateDac changes, respectively. These requests update the DIO and DAC values on the CAN device with the current values of Dio and Dac.

The onSubmit function is a handler for the form submission event. It toggles the update, updateDio, and updateDac flags, triggering the PUT requests in the useEffect hooks. The onDioChange and onDacChange functions are handlers for the change events of the DIO and DAC input fields, respectively. They update the Dio and Dac state variables with the new input values.

The component returns a form that displays the current state of the CAN device and allows the user to set the DIO and DAC values. The form has two number input fields for the DIO and DAC values and a submit button. When the form is submitted, the onSubmit function is called.
